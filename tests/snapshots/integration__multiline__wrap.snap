  [TARGET]
          Eager dogs jump over quick, lazy foxes behind brown wooden fences

OPTIONS:
      --foo <FOO>
          Sunshine gleams over hills afar, bringing warmth and hope to every
          soul, yet challenges await as we journey forth, striving for dreams
          and joy in abundance. Peaceful rivers whisper secrets gently heard.
