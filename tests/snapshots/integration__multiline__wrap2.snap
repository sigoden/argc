How to use multiline help text

an `@`,

block.

  [TARGET]
          Eager dogs jump over quick, lazy foxes behind brown wooden fences

          golden wheat fields under blue, sunny skies.
          Use '-' for standard input.

OPTIONS:
      --foo <FOO>
          Sunshine gleams over hills afar, bringing warmth and hope to every
          soul, yet challenges await as we journey forth, striving for dreams
          and joy in abundance. Peaceful rivers whisper secrets gently heard.
